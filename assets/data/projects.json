    "info": "I stumbled across an open source package called Crankshaft which can link an Android and Raspberry Pi together to allow you setup your own navigation system.  I 3D printer a housing and replaced the radio console (which was dead at this point) in hopes of making my own.  Wiring was a pain and I messed up a few details like screen orientation, but learned a lot!  While it was cool while I had it, I ended up taking out due to not being able to createa safe shutdown for the Pi and the fact a slight bump in the road would disconnet the power harness, resetting the whole thing.  Oh well.  Still learnt a lot!",
